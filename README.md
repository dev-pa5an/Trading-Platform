In the csv file orderType can vary between "bid" and "ask" only
Inorder to constraint that, defining something like a namespace for that using enum

Best way to do this is not to difine the enum class in the main function but add as a header

we have lot of data to analyze 
so we need a data structure to access these data
introducing vectors

Organize the OrderBookEntry class
OrderBookEntry.h and OrderBookEntry.cpp

Organize the functions
merkelMain.h and merkelMain.cpp
